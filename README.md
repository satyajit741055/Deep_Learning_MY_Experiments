# Deep_Learning_MY_Learning
In this Repository I am uploading my learnings of deep learning. 
1. **ANN_classification_MNIST .ipynb**
   - Created three models 
   - Model 1 
     - Simple model without using any regularization,Normalization 
     - Having Very Low accuracy 
   - Model 2 
     - Included Callbacks Functions such as Tensorboard , Early Stopping and Model Checkpointing 
     - Batch Normalization and Relu Activation Function 
     - Increased Accuracy 
     - observed with changing optimizers SGD and Adam  
   - Model 3 
     - Dropout Layers helped to increase Accuracy of model
